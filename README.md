# Reinforcement-Learning-for-optimizing- Single Fault-Detection-and-Classification
1. Objective:
Using Reinforcement Learning for optimizing Fault Detection and Classification.

2.Models for Single Fault:
For Single Fault scenarios, implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture.

3.Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning:
Both models incorporate automatic hyperparameter tuning.
Hyperparameter ranges and values:
CNN Layers: 0–5
LSTM Layers: 0–5
Dense Layers: 0–5
Epochs: 50–900
Max Pooling Layer: 0–1
Drop Layer: 0–2
Batch Normalization Layer: 0–2
Batch Size: 64–150
Learning Rate: 0.001–0.0001

4.Output:
Generate bar graphs for each identified fault.
The output will provide a clear visualization of the identified faults based on the implemented models.
